# x1nigo's hugo theme
I decided to just make my own theme for hugo. Personally, I find it easier
to add things instead of removing them &ndash; so this is a ***bare-bones*** build.

## What is hugo?
Hugo is an open-source static site generator. Unless you want to constantly
maintain your websites manually using html, hugo really helps with time, since you'll
be writing in markdown.

## Get started
Make sure you are in your website directory themes folder!
```
git clone https://github.com/x1nigo/xugo.git
```
Don't forget to add `theme = 'xugo'` in your `config.toml` file.
